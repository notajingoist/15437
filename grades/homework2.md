### Routing and configuration (20/20)

Good job!

### Calculator functionality (20/20)

Good job!

### Calculator implementation (20/20)

Good job! Although we don't really care for this assignment, in the future, do not use styling in your HTML page. Instead create a seperate css file and link it.

### Version control - Git (5/5)

Good job!

### Additional feedback

I like that you put your reasoning of why you use GET vs POST in your README. However, I think you should know that the definition of a POST method does not have to result in resource creation. The POST method can be used for many different functions, one of which is:

>Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process

So in this case, I think that POST would be more appropriate. Another reason we suggest POST for this application is to prevent your hidden fields from being shown in the URL.
